WinUI 3/WinApp controls for displaying maps from online mapping services, with optional annotations.

The library is built under NET 7, with nullability enabled.

The change log can be found [here](changes.md).

The library depends on a companion library, **J4JMapLibrary**. You can read the documentation for that library on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/markolbert/J4JMapControl/tree/main/J4JMapLibrary).
