# J4JMapLibrary and WinUI 3 Controls

## Significant Non-breaking Changes

The WinUI 3 demo app, **WinAppTest**, is now decoupled from my hosting/dependency injection libraries.

## Components

This repository contains assemblies for interacting with various online map services and displaying imagery obtained from them:

- **J4JMapLibrary** is the core library. You can find its [documentation here](J4JMapLibrary/docs/readme.md).
- **J4JMapWinLibrary** contains the actual map control. You can find its [documentation here](J4JMapWinLibrary/docs/readme.md).
- **MapLibTests** contains XUnit tests for **J4JMapLibrary**
- **WinAppTest** contains a demo WinUI 3 app (which is also used for testing)

Enjoy!
